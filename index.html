        There have been ten Formula One World Drivers' Champions representing
        the United Kingdom, winning a total of 20 titles between them including
        the 2020 season. The first champion was Mike Hawthorn, who in 1958
        became only the fourth different person to win the title. In the 15
        seasons between 1962 and 1976 the title was won by a driver representing
        the UK nine times: Graham Hill (1962, 1968), Jim Clark (1963, 1965),
        John Surtees (1964), Jackie Stewart (1969, 1971, 1973), and James Hunt
        (1976). Despite these successes, it wasn't until 2015 that a champion
        representing the UK retained their title, when Lewis Hamilton achieved
        this, following on from his victory in 2014. Hunt's victory was the last
        title until 1992, Nigel Mansell's winning season. Graham Hill's son
        Damon won in 1996 before another lengthy period without a world champion
        representing the UK. Lewis Hamilton won by just one point in 2008, with
        Jenson Button winning the following year, in 2009. Lewis Hamilton became
        the fourth multiple world champion representing the UK when he won his
        second title in 2014. The British Grand Prix has been won by eleven
        drivers representing the UK: Stirling Moss, Peter Collins, Clark,
        Stewart, Hunt, John Watson, Mansell, Damon Hill, Johnny Herbert, David
        Coulthard, and Hamilton who have won the event 25 times between them.
        Eight other men representing the UK have also won Formula One races, but
        never the British Grand Prix. These are Hawthorn, Tony Brooks, Innes
        Ireland, Graham Hill, Surtees, Peter Gethin, Eddie Irvine, and Button.
